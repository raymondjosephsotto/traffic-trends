**UI Developer Homework Project**

The final stage in the interview process is to complete a homework assignment and collaborate with our team. The assignment is meant to allow you to make your own decisions, complete a task, and present to our team  for a collaborative interview. 

**GOAL: **
This is an example of a current project that you would own. Create a vertical slice of a simple model or web application, with your choice of technologies, that can display a prediction visually online. 

We made some suggestions but it’s up to you. We want to understand

How you communicate and make decisions 
What is possible for you to accomplish in a short period of time 
How important it is for you to work with us. We’re hiring owners, not employees.

**STEPS:**

1. You will have 1-2 weeks to complete.
2. Commit your code to this repo under a new branch and give us 2-3 business days to review.
3. Setup a time to do a screenshare and walk us through what you built.


**PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:**

Develop a dashboard to display and track trends in traffic crashes in Duval County.
Data: Use the provided JSON data for traffic crashes to develop static sources.

Crash Predictions:

Predictions vs Actual:

Create a visualization of the data you loaded that works in a browser. Add some sort of interactivity, like a filter or some other UI element of your choice. And, a way to download the data in the visualization. A suggested set of libraries.

Commit the project on the Gitlab repo so that it can be downloaded and supply an adequately complete README/startup documentation for us to run it.


**NOTES:**
Asking questions for clarification on project requirements or intent is okay. Asking for code is not. :)
The above data sources are recommendations, but you are welcome to use different sources if you want. The goal is a functional vertical slice and not the use of those specific sources.
The choice of API framework/library is up to you.
Use of external tools, libraries or like to accelerate your development is fine; we’d want you to do the same at work.
